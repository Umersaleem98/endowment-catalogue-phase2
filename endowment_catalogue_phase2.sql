It is because of him that I have studied in Cadet College Hasan Abdal which is a top institution in Pakistan with a fully funded need-based scholarship. It was the same hope that my father had when he made me join NUST but itâ€™s been a whole year and I have applied for the need-based scholarship with little or no response from higherups.\nTimes are getting tough by each passing day because of the political tension in the country. My father runs a scrap shop (Kabar Khana) which is totally dependent on the industrial rates of materials like plastic and iron which are going down therefore decreasing the values of the profit on the stored material bought by the local people at a higher price.\nWe live in a 400 sq.ft place where downstairs is actually shop front and upstairs is our home consisting of two rooms, one washroom and a kitchen. It is an accommodation of six people and I must say I am happy that at least we have a place to live. Itâ€™s been a tough ride and itâ€™s getting tougher still as my father is getting old. Itâ€™s hard to watch when I see my fifty six year old father hammering fridge sheets in dirty cloths. And the harder part is that its everyday with no day offs what so ever. I know that one day I would make him proud but the responsibilities might meet the circumstances.\nRespected doners, I humbly beg of you to give me this scholarship as the the little piece of land my father had is sold and the dept is accumulating every month.

When I was about to start my university journey, my father meticulously calculated the anticipated expenses for my four-year bachelor\'s degree. At that time, the exchange rate was approximately 160 rupees per dollar, with monthly mess charges around 5000, semester hostel fees at 24000, and tuition fees at 110k. However, unforeseen circumstances unfolded over the next two years as the dollar\'s value escalated rapidly. The consequences of this currency escalation were profound. Mess bills surged to about 13000 per month, hostel fees skyrocketed to 37000 per semester, and tuition fees reached 157k per semester. The most devastating blow to our family\'s financial stability occurred in March 2022 when we experienced a robbery, resulting in a loss of 2.2 million rupeesâ€”the savings intended for children\'s education. Subsequently, the company where my father was employed began delaying salaries, eventually shutting down in March 2023. From January 2023 to August 2023, my father did not receive his salary, and the factory remains closed, leaving him unemployed.Despite efforts to find alternative employment, my father currently engages in daily wage work, earning around 20000, which barely covers basic household expenses. Previously, my father had sold a plot worth 1 million rupees when I was about to start university, using the proceeds to cover my expenses up to the 4th semester and purchase a laptop. For the 5th semester, he took a loan of 200000 from a bank to pay my tuition fees, with 14 out of 24 installments already paid. However, with the factory shutdown, the loan installments are currently on hold. To navigate the financial challenges during the 6th and 7th semesters, my father borrowed money from a family member, which remains unpaid due to the absence of income. Despite persistent efforts, my father has been unable to secure a new job, and the job search is ongoing. The current situation prohibits him from obtaining additional loans, both from the bank and family members, given the outstanding loan and unpaid borrowings. These circumstances have left our family incapable of affording the cost of my education, and with one semester remaining to complete my degree, the NUST Need-Based Scholarship represents a crucial lifeline for me and my family during these trying times.', 'Required Financial Support', 0, 0, '0', '1739180291_Blue backgroundffbl - Islam Nawaz.png', '2025-08-22 04:50:36', '2025-08-22 04:50:36'),
